Goal:
1) is to Visualize the Covid 19 Dataset for better understanding and understanding the epidemiological models.
2) determine the total number of infected and Doubling rate.
3) SIR model simulation for more than 100 countries.

This project is done in Python. I have used Dash Library for Visualisation.


Main File is Visualize.py which contains all the code required for visualisation. 

Visualize_SIR,py contains code for SIR modeling but you have to run only visualize.py for overall visualisation.


Dashboard contains two tabs 1st tab contains the visualisation of covid 19 dataset for multiple countries along with doubling rate whereas 2nd tab contains SIR prediction model.
